### 👨‍💻 About Me
Currently working as an AI intern at the European Space Agency (ESA), I am a French student pursuing a Double Master in Machine Learning at Polytechnique Montréal (Canada) after 2 years at École des Mines de Saint-Étienne (France). Passionate about computer science and mathematics, I'm driven to explore and develop AI solutions that transform our technological interactions and expand the frontiers of space exploration. For more details, you can view my full resume [here](http://theogachet.com/resume-theo-gachet).
